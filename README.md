# 3D Object Creation with OpenGL

This program demonstrates how to create a 3D object using the OpenGL graphics library. The program is written in both C++ and Python.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- C++ Compiler (like g++, clang)
- Python 3.x
- OpenGL library

## Running the C++ Code

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the C++ file.
3. Compile the C++ file using your compiler. For example, if you're using g++, you can use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o output_file_name source_file_name.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
```

Replace `output_file_name` with the name you want for your compiled program, and source_file_name.cpp with the name of your C++ file.

# Running the Python Code
1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
3. Run the Python file with the following command:
4. Replace source_file_name.py with the name of your Python file.
